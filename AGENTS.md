## Overview

**LCK Pro Player Stats** is a single-purpose web app for exploring League of
Legends *pro-play* statistics for four LCK players — **Teddy, Ruler, Kiin,
Zeus**. Users search a player, filter by season (S14/S15/S16 = 2024/2025/2026)
and split, browse a per-champion grid, and compare the player against the **LCK
role average** for the same timeframe. Scope is intentionally narrow: **LCK games
only**, four players only.

Source data is Oracle's Elixir yearly esports match CSVs (not committed).

## Tech stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI + Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy 2.x (ORM), Pydantic 2.x, pandas
  (CSV loading). Python 3.
- **Database**: SQLite (`data/lol_performance.db`, WAL mode), single table
  `player_game_stats`.
- **Frontend**: vanilla JS/HTML/CSS — **no build step, no framework**, served
  statically by FastAPI. Champion images from Riot Data Dragon.
- **Tests**: pytest + httpx (FastAPI `TestClient`).

## Setup & commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (use requirements-dev.txt to also get pytest/httpx)
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 2. Add data: download the Oracle's Elixir CSVs from
#    https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads and drop them in data/raw/
#    (files named e.g. 2025_LoL_esports_match_data_from_OraclesElixir.csv)

# 3. Load CSVs into SQLite (LCK rows only; auto-discovers data/raw/*.csv).
#    Rebuilds the table from scratch each run.
python -m backend.load_data

# 4. Run the app (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
python run.py

# 5. Run tests (no data download or DB required — tests seed their own)
pytest
```

The CSVs and the `.db` file are gitignored; the loader logs `[OK]`/`!! NOT FOUND`
per pro so you can confirm the four names matched.

## Architecture / data flow

CSV (`data/raw/`) → `backend/load_data.py` filters to LCK + target seasons and
writes `player_game_stats` → `backend/api/stats.py` aggregates rows into the
metrics on demand → `backend/api/routes.py` returns Pydantic models → the static
frontend renders comparison tables. API surface:

- `GET /api/players` — the four searchable players.
- `GET /api/player/{name}/filters` — seasons/splits the player actually has games in.
- `GET /api/player/{name}/stats?season=&split=&champion=` — overall metrics, LCK
  role baseline, per-champion breakdown, and optional single-champion comparison.

Unknown player names return **404** (allowlist enforced in `config.find_player`).

## Conventions

- **Config-driven scope.** The player allowlist and year→season map live in
  [backend/config.py](backend/config.py). Player `name` must match Oracle's
  `playername` **exactly** (the loader verifies this). To add a player or season,
  edit `PLAYERS` / `SEASONS` there, not scattered constants.
- **Champion name overrides** go in `_OVERRIDES` in
  [backend/champions.py](backend/champions.py). If a champion image 404s, add the
  Oracle-name → Data Dragon-id mapping there rather than patching call sites.
- **Python style** (match the surrounding code): module-level docstrings, typed
  signatures (`int | None`), small private helpers prefixed `_`, `logging` over
  `print`.
- **Frontend has no bundler.** Edit `frontend/js/*.js` directly. When changing a
  static asset, bump its `?v=` query param in `index.html` (the no-cache
  middleware only covers `/` and `/static`).

## Testing

- Run with `pytest`. Tests need no real data/DB.
- `tests/conftest.py` builds a temp SQLite DB seeded with deterministic synthetic
  rows and monkeypatches it into `backend.database._engine`, so the API routes
  read from it. `TestClient(app)` is created **without** a context manager on
  purpose — that skips the FastAPI startup event (which hits the network for the
  Data Dragon version and opens the real DB).
- Add new API tests to `tests/test_api.py` following the existing
  `client.get(...).json()` assertion style.

## Gotchas

- **`load_data` is destructive**: it deletes and rebuilds the table every run.
- **LCK-only**: non-LCK games are dropped at load time — e.g. Ruler's 2024 LPL
  season is excluded, so his season filter only offers years he has LCK games in.
- **KDA is an aggregate ratio** (sum of K+A over sum of D), *not* the mean of
  per-game KDAs — see [backend/api/stats.py](backend/api/stats.py). This handles
  deathless games naturally.
- **Partial-data games**: at-15 differentials and gold/damage shares are averaged
  only over games where Oracle provides the value (nulls are filtered), while
  games still count toward totals.
- **Port 8000 is shared** with a sibling `predictionmodel` app. The no-cache
  middleware in [backend/main.py](backend/main.py) exists to stop a browser from
  running the sibling's cached frontend against this backend — don't remove it.
